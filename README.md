### gs_logger

## Installation
Add gs-logger to your Godot project, you can do this by grabbing the latest release and adding it to your project. Or, you can use the Asset Library to include it in your project. If you are very adventurous, you could even try using the godot-stuff Project Manager (gspm) as well.

## How To Use

## Releasing


## Version Naming Convention
Because we want to ensure that the tools I create follow the version of Godot they are supporting, I use a naming convention that combines the Version of Godot it supports, with an additional Release number. For example,

Version 3.1-R1

This support Godot 3.1, and is the First Release of the software.

In general, we will not include patches that Godot releases, instead we will try to ensure that the Major.Minor version of the Release we are creating is compatible with all Patches. If there comes a time where that does not work, we will determines how to handle it at that time.
